    - Colours
- Coding imports + deciding on comment strategy

- Discovered SASS import is even easier than I thought
- Tip to myself : Take a fun approach, accept frustration
- separating all the css by elements, etc...
- Firt menu design steps, I want a logo ! => Free logo creator sites are bad, desiginng one in CSS
- Learned about font gradient
- learned to convert old webkit code into usable code
- migrating this list to this document. Before, it was handwritten
- SASS compiler doesn't compile the target sass import as intended ... Going to use a tool Igor told me
- Styling/developing the menu
- Layout is getting better / designing the buttons/anchors !!! 
- Getting bored after 4H working on this part
- display: none'd the menu ^^ starting my nice design sidebar
- design is doing good; function to open/close the menu so first add of javascript to the page
- feels like because of the number of classes/different/languages there seem to be naming issues not yet big enought to retake the whole naming synthax
