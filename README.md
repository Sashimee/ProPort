- Getting bored after 4H working on this part
- display: none'd the menu ^^ starting my nice design sidebar
- design is doing good; function to open/close the menu so first add of javascript to the page
- feels like because of the number of classes/different/languages there seem to be naming issues not yet big enought to retake the whole naming synthax
